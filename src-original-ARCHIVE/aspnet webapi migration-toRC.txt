all of these are related to the fact that there's no more HttpResponseMessage<T> - 
	new pattern is to return HttpReponseMessage and create it with ApiController.Request::CreateResponse<T> method
	this also means that I need to rewrite all of my tests that verify both the response message and the value
		there's a helper on the response called TryGetContentValue<T> for this 
		it means more test code, but not necessarily the end of the world

I removed the code that threw an exception for 404 status codes and instead simply created a new HttpResponseMessage with a 404 status code

looks like the signature changed on mediatypeformatter
	protected override Task OnWriteToStreamAsync(Type type, object value, Stream stream, HttpContentHeaders contentHeaders, FormatterContext formatterContext, TransportContext transportContext)

once I changed my services to return HttpResponseMessage rather than HttpResponseMessage<T>, I also ended up needing to fix up all of my unit tests

major changes in dependency resolver - need to get additional guidance on what these were all about

looks like there was some bug in the way I was managing my stream/stream writer inside my razor formatter

still an issue with content negotiation - especially when the user agent is a browser.  It seems to have something to do with how we handle wildcard values in the accept header
	looks like upgrading to the nightly package builds fixed that issue

now an issue where action selection is failing for posts that rely on model binding to include custom types as parameters
