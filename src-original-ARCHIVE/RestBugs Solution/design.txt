spike: enable resource hierchies:
	- enable a URI template parameter to exist more than once in a parameter (e.g. "{controller[2]}" or "{controller}/{controller}"
	- Write a custom IRouteHandler that can look at a file system convention (either a controller with a concatenated name or a folder/namespace hierarchy (folder hierarchy seems more consistent with MVC view conventions)) and select a controller

	figure out how to enable something like this "{controller}/{id}/{controller"}
		- should the instance of my child controller be able to specify a ctor parameter which would be populated with the value of {controller}/{id}?

spike: implement search via forms:

spike: automate end to end API testing using Web test tools
	- would be cool to also see if Web load testing tools could be used for testing the REST API
